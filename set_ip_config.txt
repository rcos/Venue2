# Provided the old IP is not the new IP, every instance of the old IP will be replaced with new IP.
# The integrity check function will let you know if it detects irregularities between the number of IP's
# each file is supposed to have vs. the amount of IP's it does have. This does not include domains.

	warnings: true


# Fatal errors will still be printed in red and most likely crash the program, but yellow warnings will not get printed if this is set to [FALSE].



    	use_getch: true


# Getch is a python library that allows the use of arrow keys in the input buffer. If you set use_getch to [FALSE] then you can still
# use numbers to select your desired action in the main menu, but it won't feel as cool as using arrow keys.



    	SameSite: true


# SameSite is a property that lives inside the login cookie that makes it possible to login and logout from a different IP.
# This is default [FALSE] because it's a security feature that improves the integrity of a cookie.
# If logging in doesn't work from a non-localhost IP, set this to [TRUE] - but make sure to set it to [FALSE] before doing a PR!!!


	cross_origin: true


# Cross origin is the big brother of SameSite when it comes to cookie security. Setting cross origin to [TRUE] will let you log in
# from both localhost AND new_ip. Leaving cross origin set to false will make the site only accessible from the new_ip.
# Caution must be taken when changing this value, make sure you set it to [FALSE] before a PR!!!
# * The line "origin:" in server/server.js should have 3 origins: venue-meetings.com, localhost, googleStorageApi
